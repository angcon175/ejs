      Tarty giant letter generator uses text symbols ▓▒░▄█▀▌▐─. █▀█ █▄█ ▀█▀ /
      █▬█ █ ▀█▀ font (no, not ▟▛ █▬█ █ ▜▛ font) uses a different bunch of
      symbols to fonm letters. By the way, check out my collection of text
      drawings. ≧^◡^≦ When you'll find a copy of my big text generators around
      the internet - there's plenty of copies, please know that this is the
      actual original and we actually designed all of these big letters with my
      friends, including ASCII Text Art Generator and 𝗧𝗲𝘅𝘁 font copy paste.
      Proud and angry!
